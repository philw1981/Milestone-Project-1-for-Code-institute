# Milestone Project 1 for Code institute

A Photography Website for a new buisness

A live demo can be found at GitHub here https://philw1981.github.io/

## UX

The aim of this project was to create a fictional photographer website with the long term aim of it developing into a actual website for my wife's part time photography business. With this project I was able to apply a layout and style that we could use as a draft for what we though would or would not work. The project was developed to see if the three main services that my wife offers would work well from one site & one scrolling page , one site with multiple pages or if three separate sites would work best.

I went with creating one site, one page scrolling split into section's and then one page for the gallery. The colours are very light and minimal with an aim of having plenty of space for photos to show to the users of the site. Right now all photos are from Pexels as due to time and this being a project only build. The design and colours have been inspired by local and popular photography sites in the area that would be the competition.

The idea was to mention key information with a good selection of phtots to show the flexibility of the photographer. The site has two parts that the user can then use to contact the photographer.

## Wire frame's

- Balsamiq was used to design the initial layout (these can be used via the wireframes folder). The idea was to keep the layout simple and consistent. As I started to work on the website the actual design changed as I felt I needed to add in features such as the carousel & lightbox to really highlight the photos for the website as this is the purpose for the user.

## About

- I decided this should be at the start of the site but only a small section so that the user is introduced t
  o the photographer and gets some key information such as services, style.

## Carousel

-This was took from the bootstrap 4 libraries. It is directly beneath the about section so it can showcase the three key areas the photographer works in and has a link to the relevant gallery so the user can look at a wider range of the photographers works.

## Weddings

-This section was put in first of the three main services as it would be the main service provided by the photographer and also one of the top services user search for.

## Commercial

## Portrait

## Features

-Carousel

-Pricing contact form

-Gallery

## Contact

This felt a key area as the website does not sell anything directly as a e-commerce site would but its purpose is top get the user and photographer discussing the service on offer. So I decided to put a main contact form near the top and a smaller contact button in the form of a modal took from bootstrap in case people jump past the first part going to the relevant section.

## Features to Implement in future

It felt tricky having the three services on the website in terms of layout and colour scheme. Going forward it might be best having the sections on a page each. More links to the works of the photographer via social media, videos of photo-shoots taking place, reviews and testimonials would all help explain the services. Also due to time the photographer would have their own works on the site.

## Testing

\*Carousel
Dev Tools used to try and work out how best to the imges to a similar size and consistent without taking over the top part of the Website.

\*Nav bar & menu in smaller device size
Wehn in Dev tools it did not seem to fit the screen 100% or avoid opverlap in difrent screen sizes, when I tested on actual devices this did not happen..

\*Gallery
Light box feature helped user experince avoiding back button in mobile screens to get back to the gallery, instead just tappiung below the image takes you back to the gallery page and also added the scroll fucntion back and fourth through the whole gallery for easy access to all images.
