# Milestone Project 1 for Code institute

A Photography Website for a new buisness

A live demo can be found at GitHub here https://philw1981.github.io/

## UX

The aim of this project was to create a fictional photographer website with the long term aim of it developing into a actual website for my wife's part time photography business. With this project I was able to apply a layout and style that we could use as a draft for what we though would or would not work. The project was developed to see if the three main services that my wife offers would work well from one site & one scrolling page , one site with multiple pages or if three separate sites would work best.

I went with creating one site, one page scrolling split into section's and then one page for the gallery. The colours are very light and minimal with an aim of having plenty of space for photos to show to the users of the site. Right now all photos are from Pexels as due to time and this being a project only build. The design and colours have been inspired by local and popular photography sites in the area that would be the competition.

The idea was to mention key information with a good selection of phtots to show the flexability of the phtotgrapher. The site has two parts that the user can then use to contact the photographer.

## Wireframe's

- Balsamiq was used to design the inital layout (these can be used via the wireframs folder). The idea was to keep the layout simple and consistent. As I started to work on the website the actual dsign chganged as I felt I needed to add in features such as the carousel & lightbox to really highligh the photos for the website as this is th purpose for the user.

## About

- I decided this should be at the start opf the site but only a small section so that the user is introduced tpo the phtotgrapher and gets some key informtion such as services, style.

## Carousel

-This was took from the boostrap 4 libries. It is directly beneth the about section so it can showcase the three key areas the photographer works in and has a link to the relevant gallery so the user can look at a wider range of the photographers works.

## Weddings

-This section was put in first of the three main services as it would be the mian service provided by the phtotgrapher and also one of the top services user serach for.

## Commercial

## Portrait

## Features

-Carousel

-Pricing conact form

-Gallery

## Contact

This felt a key area as the website doies not sell anything directly as a ecommerce siote would but its purpoise is top get the user and phttographer discussing the service on offer. So I decided to put a main contact form near the top and a smaller conatct button in the form of a modal took from boostrap in case people jump past the first part going to the relevant section.

## Features to Implement in future

It felt tricky having the three services on the website in terms of layout and colour scheme. Going forward it might be best having the sections on a page each. More links to the works of th photograoher via social media,viedos of phtotshoots taking place, reviews and testimonals would all help explain the servies. Also due to time the phtotgrapher would have thier own works on the site
