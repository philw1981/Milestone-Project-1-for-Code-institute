# Milestone Project 1 for Code institute

A Photography Website for a new buisness

## UX

The aim of this project was to create a fictional photographer website with the long term aim of it developing into a actual website for my wife's part time photography business. With this project I was able to apply a layout and style that we could use as a draft for what we though would or would not work. The project was developed to see if the three main services that my wife offers would work well from one site & one scrolling page , one site with multiple pages or if three separate sites would work best.

I went with creating one site, one page scrolling split into section's. The colours are very light and minimal with an aim of having plenty of space for photos to show to the users of the site. Right now all photos are from Pexels as due to time and this being a project only build. The design and colours have been inspired by local and popular photography sites in the area that would be the competition.
