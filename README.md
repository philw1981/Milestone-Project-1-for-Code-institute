# Milestone Project 1 for Code institute

A Photography Website for a new business.

A live demo can be found at GitHub here https://philw1981.github.io/

## UX

The aim of this project was to create a fictional photographer website with the long term aim of it developing into a actual website for my wife's part time photography business. With this project I was able to apply a layout and style that we could use as a draft for what we though would or would not work. The project was developed to see if the three main services that my wife offers would work well from one site & one scrolling page , one site with multiple pages or if three separate sites would work best.

I went with creating one site, one page scrolling split into section's and then one page for the gallery. The colours are very light and minimal with an aim of having plenty of space for photos to show to the users of the site. Right now all photos are from Pexels as due to time and this being a project only build. The design and colours have been inspired by local and popular photography sites in the area that would be the competition.

The idea was to mention key information with a good selection of photos to show the flexibility of the photographer. The site has two parts that the user can then use to contact the photographer.

## Wire frame's

- Balsamiq was used to design the initial layout (these can be used via the wireframes folder). The idea was to keep the layout simple and consistent. As I started to work on the website the actual design changed as I felt I needed to add in features such as the carousel & lightbox to really highlight the photos for the website as this is the purpose for the user.

## User Stories

- As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site.
- As a new visitor to the website, I want learn more about the Photographer.
- As a new visitor to the website, I want to look at their Photography skills.
- As a new visitor to the website, I want view the Photographers gallery, and help me to decide if I want to contact them to provide a service.
- As an interested client, I want to be able to make contact easily.
- As an interested client, I want to be able to understand what services are on offer.
- As an interested client, I want to know what geographical areas are covered in regards to the service.

## About

- I decided this should be at the start of the site but only a small section so that the user is introduced t
  o the photographer and gets some key information such as services, style.

## Carousel

- This was took from the bootstrap 4 libraries. It is directly beneath the about section so it can showcase the three key areas the photographer works in and has a link to the relevant gallery so the user can look at a wider range of the photographers works.

## Weddings

- This section was put in first of the three main services as it would be the main service provided by the photographer and also one of the top services user search for.

## Commercial

- This section is to show the user a selection of styles & services that can help bring to life a business brand,identity or vision. This section is to show the user how this service can help get the message across to the business's viewers.

## Portrait

-This section is used to highlight the diffrent types of portrait photogrphay availiablke to the user and to explain the serivecs on offer to potential clients.

## Features

- Carousel

To act as a eye-catching taster of the services offered to the user and to show relevant content or showcase professional photos and add as direct link to the gallery of choice by the user.

- Pricing contact form

- Gallery

## Contact

This felt a key area as the website does not sell anything directly as a e-commerce site would but its purpose is top get the user and photographer discussing the service on offer. So I decided to put a main contact form near the top and a smaller contact button in the form of a modal took from bootstrap in case people jump past the first part going to the relevant section.

## Features to Implement in future

- The use of more carousels and larger gallery sections would greatly increase the range of styles and skills the photographer can showcase to the user's

- Forms and social media links to connect work as intended.

- More links to the works of the photographer via social media and videos of photo-shoots taking place.

- photographer's would have their own works on the site.

- Reviews and testimonials would all help explain the quality and flexibility of the services to the user.

- The information regarding services needs to be a lot more detailed.

- A geographical map feature to show in detail what travel distance the photographer will cover.

- Going forward it might be best having the first page as an overall landing page and then the sections have a page each in much more detail.

## Testing

- Responsivness
  Along side Dev tools and peoples actual devices I used this website to help keep my project mobile first.[Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/)

- Carousel
  Dev Tools used to try and work out how best to get the images to a similar size and consistent without taking over the top part of the Website. The size of the carousel might have worled better with reduced height.

- Nav bar & menu in smaller device size
  When in Dev tools it did not seem to fit the screen 100% or avoid overlap in different screen sizes, when I tested on actual devices this did not happen..

- Gallery
  Light box feature helped user experience avoiding back button in mobile screens to get back to the gallery, instead just tapping below the image takes you back to the gallery page and also added the scroll function back and fourth through the whole gallery for easy access to all images.

  - Feedback
    I had a couple of people feedback the site could maybe do with a litle bit more colour. But overall the feedback on the theme and layout was positive. Everyone though the site was easy to use and navigate.

- Through out the project I used the below regualry to troublwshoot and solve issues as I went along.

- Dev Tools
- Tested on muliple browsers
- HTML Formatter
- Validator W3
- Autoprefixer

## Deployment

I've deployed the site using GitHub Pages, and is available here:[https://github.com/philw1981/philw1981.github.io](https://github.com/philw1981/philw1981.github.io)

Through out I used git........I also used Github Desktop. I found when I had deployed my coide to github pages I had to go back and change the filepath for he images and simple lightbox to work as intended.
